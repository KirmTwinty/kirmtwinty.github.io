Getting Matlab to work with Emacs
=================================

First of all you will need to get Matlab inside Emacs. Happily for you,

You can get it from MELPA: Otherwise you can still get the source at
<https://sourceforge.net/p/matlab-emacs/src/ci/master/tree/>

To configure it, just go through the documentation
